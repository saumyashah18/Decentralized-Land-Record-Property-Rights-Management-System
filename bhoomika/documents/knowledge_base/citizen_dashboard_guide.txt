## Understanding ULPIN (Bhu-Aadhar)

### What is ULPIN?

ULPIN (Unique Land Parcel Identification Number), also known as Bhu-Aadhar, is a 14-digit unique identification number for every land parcel in India.

### How ULPIN is Generated

1. **Geographic Coordinates**: Based on your property's latitude and longitude
2. **Administrative Boundaries**: Incorporates state, district, and sub-district codes
3. **Parcel-Specific Data**: Unique identifier for the specific plot

### Why ULPIN Matters

- **Nationwide Compatibility**: Works across all states and territories
- **Prevents Duplication**: Each parcel has exactly one ULPIN
- **Enables Digital Transactions**: Foundation for blockchain-based property records
- **Interoperability**: Compatible with other government systems

### Where to Find Your ULPIN

- Displayed prominently on every property card
- Shown in Property Details view
- Included in all official documents
- Used for search and verification

## Blockchain Technology Explained

### Hybrid Architecture

BhoomiSetu uses two blockchain layers for optimal security and transparency:

**1. Hyperledger Fabric (Authoritative Layer)**:
- **Purpose**: Primary ledger for governance and property metadata
- **Privacy**: Permissioned network - only authorized registrars can commit data
- **Function**: Handles land transfers, ownership records, and complex transactions
- **Storage**: SHA256 hashes of all assets in the Fabric State Database

**2. Polygon Amoy (Public Verification Layer)**:
- **Purpose**: Immutable public proof
- **Transparency**: Anyone can verify records without seeing private data
- **Function**: Periodic "anchoring" of Fabric state hashes to public Ethereum network
- **Verification**: Compare local hash with public anchor to detect tampering

### How It Protects You

**Immutability**:
- Once recorded, data cannot be altered or deleted
- Historical records are permanently preserved
- Prevents backdating or fraudulent modifications

**Transparency**:
- All transactions are traceable
- Public verification without exposing private details
- Zero-knowledge trust model

**Security**:
- Cryptographic hashing ensures data integrity
- Multi-signature requirements for critical actions
- Distributed ledger prevents single point of failure

**Decentralization**:
- No single authority controls the entire system
- Reduces corruption and manipulation risks
- Government oversight with public accountability
